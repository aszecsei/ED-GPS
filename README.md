# Elite: Dangerous Navigational Assistant
-----------------------------------------

## Installation
This project is in a state of **extreme** beta. As such, there are no binaries, and you'll have to edit the code to reflect the location of your Elite: Dangerous logs.

Also, this program uses verbose logging, so if you haven't already done so, you'll need to add the line VerboseLogging="1" to your AppConfig.xml file. Eventually, users will be able to supply the location of their AppConfig.xml file and automatically enable verbose logging and use it to determine the location of logs.

## Use
This program is designed to provide a copilot for complex journeys that the Elite: Dangerous computer is unable to handle. It allows cyclical routes, directing you to a specified station, and so forth. It uses publicly collected data to determine your route, so it will be unlikely to - for example - navigate you thousands of light-years across the galaxy.

If there *is* a way to navigate you light-years across the galaxy, let me know and I'll do my best to add that functionality in.
