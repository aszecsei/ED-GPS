# Elite: Dangerous Navigational Assistant
-----------------------------------------

## Installation
This project is in a state of **early** development. As such, there are no binaries, and you'll have to edit the code to reflect the location of your Elite: Dangerous logs.

Also, this program uses verbose logging, so if you haven't already done so, you'll need to add the line VerboseLogging="1" to your AppConfig.xml file. Eventually, users will be able to supply the location of their AppConfig.xml file and automatically enable verbose logging and use it to determine the location of logs.

## Use
This program is designed to provide a copilot for complex journeys that the Elite: Dangerous computer is unable to handle. It will allow cyclical routes, direct you to a specified station, and inform you what you planned to buy or sell there. It will use publicly collected data to determine your route, so it will be unlikely to be able to navigate you across the galaxy. It will, however, be useful for navigation along trading routes.
